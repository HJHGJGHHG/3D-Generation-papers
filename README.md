## A. 3D Image Synthesis

> *Recent years have seen remarkable progress in deep learning powered visual content creation. This includes 3D-aware generative image synthesis, which produces high-fidelity images in a 3D-consistent manner while simultaneously capturing compact surfaces of objects from pure image collections without the need for any 3D supervision, thus bridging the gap between 2D imageryand 3D reality.*  -Xia et.al

#### A.1 3D Multiple Views Synthesis
This section mainly focuses on methods that aim to render novel views by learning a deep neural representation from multi-view image collections of a scene or object.
